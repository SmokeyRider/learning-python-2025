Okay, so I have this list of grocery items that needs to be categorized into appropriate departments like Produce, Dairy, Meat, etc., then sorted alphabetically within each category. Alright, let's break it down step by step.

First, I need to go through each item and figure out which department it belongs to. Starting with the first one: Apples. That sounds like it should be in Produce because apples are fruits. Next is Chicken Breast; that's definitely meat. Milk comes to mind as a dairy product. Bread, hmm, bread is typically categorized under Produce too since it's a staple food.

Carrots—those are vegetables, so they go into Produce as well. Orange Juice and Yogurt: Orange juice is a beverage, but yogurt falls under Dairy. Eggs would be in the Eggs department, which I think might fall under Dairy or perhaps a separate category? Wait, eggs are usually their own category sometimes called Eggs or Poultry. Let me check that.

Spinach—vegetables, so Produce. Cereal—it’s a breakfast item, but where does cereal go? Sometimes it's grouped with grains, which could be in Produce, but I think Cereal is its own separate category under Groceries. Maybe I should list it as its own department.

Tomatoes are fruits and vegetables, so they'd go into Produce. Pasta—wheat pasta is a grain, so again, another category on its own, maybe called Grains or just Produce? Probably better to create a separate category for Grains since pasta is a type of grain.

Rice is similar; it's a staple in many diets and often categorized under Grains. Butter is dairy, so Dairy. Salmon—seafood, which would be its own department. Broccoli is a vegetable, so Produce. Almonds are nuts, I think they go into Nuts, which might be part of Produce or maybe their own category.

Potatoes—are these potatoes vegetables? Yes, so Produce. Onions and Garlic are both vegetables as well. Let me double-check—I think onions are in Produce but Garlic is often its own category since it's sometimes used fresh or powdered. Maybe Garlic should be its own section?

Strawberries—definitely a fruit, so Produce. Coffee is a beverage. Tea is also a beverage. Sugar—can sugar go into Bakery if it's for baking? Or maybe it's just listed as its own item without a department.

Flour and Bread both relate to grains; flour is used in cooking, while bread is baked. So Grains would be the right category for both. Oats are also a grain, so they fit there too. Olive Oil is usually categorized under Dairy or sometimes separately as it's an oil product. Honey—similar reasoning, maybe under Bakery if it's for baking, but often listed in its own section.

Peanut Butter is a protein product; maybe separate. Jam is fruit-based, so Produce. Sausages are meat products, so Meat. Granola Bars are usually breakfast items, sometimes categorized separately as Snacks or Breakfast.

Oatmeal—can be considered a grain since it's made from oats but can also be a breakfast item. Maybe better to put it under Grains for now unless specified otherwise. Ice Cream is a dessert, often in its own category. Soda is a beverage.

Chips are snacks, so their own category. Chocolate is a confectionery product—often grouped with Bakery items if they're used in desserts but sometimes as standalone.

Toilet Paper and Paper Towels are household products, so Paper Products. Dish Soap and Laundry Detergent are cleaning supplies; maybe combined under Cleaning Supplies or separately listed for each function (like Detergent specifically).

Shampoo is a beauty product or personal care item. Toothpaste is another personal care item. Sugar—if not used in baking, perhaps just listed as its own item without a department.

Wait, I think I might have missed some items earlier. Let me go through the list again to make sure each one is correctly categorized:
