# Repository: Learning Python

This repository contains various Python scripts created while learning Python.

- This repository is a work in progress and is updated as new concepts are learned.
- Contributions or suggestions are welcome!

## Scripts Overview

### `cars.py`
A script for experimenting with Python object manipulation. It includes examples of working with classes, objects, and methods.

### `categorizer.py`
A script that reads a file containing a list of grocery items and categorizes them using hardcoded values. This script is based on a YouTube tutorial and demonstrates basic file handling and categorization.

### `nines.py`
A script that prints the multiplication table for the number 9. This script is a simple demonstration of loops and basic arithmetic in Python.

### `Jupyter_nb.ipynb`
A Jupyter Notebook containing examples and experiments with Python code. This notebook is used for interactive learning and exploring Python concepts.

### Codespaces Configuration
This repository is pre-configured to work seamlessly with GitHub Codespaces.

### Setting up a virtual Python environment 
Setting up a virtual Python environment is a good idea if not running in Codespaces. Here are the steps to set it up in PowerShell:
```powershell
python -m venv myenv
myenv\scripts\activate
